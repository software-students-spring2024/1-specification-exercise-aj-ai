Blaine Browning:
Blaine is a senior at NYU who is currently taking many classes as he finishes the requirements for graduation. He needs to stay on top of his assignments as he does not want to jeopardize his graduation by not passing a class. He also is applying for jobs and hopes to get one soon after graduation. Additionally, Blaine wants to have time to hang out with friends and enjoy his senior spring semester. Blaine is focused firstly on keeping up with his academics, then with finding employment, and finally will devote time to spend with friends during his final college days.

Blaine sometimes gets frustrated using Brightspace as he does not want to constantly go through the different pages to find when his assignments are due, especailly because he is taking five classes. He also does not enjoy having to use Brightspace through his phone web browser that requires his log in verification every time his logs on. Blaine gets similarly frustrated trying to keep track of the various job application due dates that are scattered across different websites. Sometimes Blaine misprioritizes certain tasks and ends up spending more time on tasks that are less important, leaving him with less time for more vital tasks.
